use</h2><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><div class="description"><p class="paragraph">PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW) ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.</p><p class="paragraph">Effective Date: January 15th, 2022</p><p class="paragraph">Welcome to DIAMBRA. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact us at info@diambra.ai. <br/> These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and DIAMBRA. (“DIAMBRA,” “we” and “us”). DIAMBRA is not a legal entity nor a company. It is a group of people collaborating around an idea and a mission, and providing Services for free and for fun. <br/> You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy. In these Terms, the words “include” or “including” mean “including but not limited to”, and examples are for illustration purposes and are not limiting. <br/> In these Terms, as well as in the Privacy Policy, with DIAMBRA Arena we identify our Freeware Software Package that can be downloaded from our GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/diambra/arena" target="_blank">https://github.com/diambra/arena</a>) or our Docker hub profile (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/diambra" target="_blank">https://hub.docker.com/u/diambra</a>), and that is described in detail on our DIAMBRA Arena Docs website (<a href="https://docs.diambra.ai" target="_blank">https://docs.diambra.ai</a>). <br/> These Terms cover DIAMBRA Arena usage too, as its usage falls under the, above mentioned, definition of “Services”.</p></div><div class="description mt-4"><h4 class="paragraph-title">1. Will these Terms ever change?</h4><p class="paragraph">We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on DIAMBRA website, by sending you an email, or by some other means. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 14 days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p><p class="paragraph">Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p></div><div class="description mt-4"><h4 class="paragraph-title">2. What about my privacy?</h4><p class="paragraph">DIAMBRA takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current DIAMBRA Privacy Policy, please click <a href="/privacy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div><div class="description mt-4"><h4 class="paragraph-title">3. What are the basics of using DIAMBRA?</h4><p class="paragraph">You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and username/battle-name (“DIAMBRA User ID”). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your DIAMBRA User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission. In the spirit of fairness, you may not have or control more than one active DIAMBRA User ID. If we determine that you are operating under more than one DIAMBRA User ID, we may revoke access to your DIAMBRA User ID.</p><p class="paragraph">You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract. If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract, please see the Privacy Policy and contact us at info@diambra.ai for more information on the parental consent process. You must either be of legal age to form a binding contract or have completed the parental consent process to use the Services.</p><p class="paragraph">If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity), but you are still required to sign up each individual user from your organization with a DIAMBRA User ID. You are not allowed to allow multiple individuals to operate under one DIAMBRA User ID, even if you are an organization or entity.</p><p class="paragraph">You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We are not responsible if you use the Services in a way that breaks the law.</p><p class="paragraph">You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.</p></div><div class="description mt-4"><h4 class="paragraph-title">4. Are there any additional restrictions on my use of the Services?</h4><p class="paragraph">Yes. You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not interact with the Services in a manner that:</p><ul class="paragraph"><li>Violates the Acceptable Use Policy;</li><li>Is harmful, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;</li><li>“Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);</li><li>Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content;</li></ul><p class="paragraph">Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.</p><p class="paragraph">Without limitation to any other remedies available to DIAMBRA, a violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services. We reserve the right to remove any Content or User Submissions from the Services at any time, for any reason (including if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), and without notice.</p></div><div class="description mt-4"><h4 class="paragraph-title">5. What are my rights in DIAMBRA?</h4><p class="paragraph">The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, and illustrations (collectively, the “Content”), are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license,  sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including DIAMBRA’s) rights.</p><p class="paragraph">You understand that DIAMBRA runs the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p><p class="paragraph">The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply — they do!</p></div><div class="description mt-4"><h4 class="paragraph-title">6. Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</h4><p class="paragraph">Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk. We aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p><p class="paragraph">You are responsible for all Content you contribute to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so.</p><p class="paragraph">The Services may contain links, information or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by DIAMBRA. When you access third party websites or engage with third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that DIAMBRA is not responsible for such risks.

What is DIAMBRA Arena and what are Environments?</h4><p class="paragraph">DIAMBRA Arena is a software package that allows users to interact with a video game emulator software implementing a standard communication interface. This interface restricts the emulator functionality, allowing to interact with it only by means of software programs that need to be created ad hoc (the “software agent”, or “agent”). <br/> It has been built to foster Reinforcement Learning research and experimentation. It provides interfaces to a given set of games, opening the possibility to use them as Reinforcement Learning Environments. <br/> An “Environment” will accept the agent’s actions and generate a new state. An episode is an Environment running one or more agents until done. The agent’s activity in an episode may be available for viewing and download.</p><p class="paragraph">Each Environment may be subject to additional rules, for example, describing how many agents are needed to participate in an episode, how an agent’s performance is better or worse, and the final outcome needed for an episode to be done. Each episode may be part of a larger grouping of multiple episodes.</p><p class="paragraph paragraph-bold">Environments provided by DIAMBRA Arena are a mere software interface to existing video games, and they cannot work as a standalone application. As such, they require the User to own software elements protected by copyright, and to interface them with the Environment itself. It is the case, for example, of Game ROMS required to execute the corresponding Game-related Environment. In such cases, it is sole and only responsibility of the User to comply with all the laws and regulations, and to make sure he has the right to use such copyright-protected material. DIAMBRA members will spend their maximum effort in avoiding illegal distribution of such material, and are by no means responsible for copyright infringement.</p></div><div class="description mt-4"><h4 class="paragraph-title">8. What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</h4><p class="paragraph">You may have heard of the DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019 / 790 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL, as it relates to online service providers, like DIAMBRA, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers. To review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content contact us at info@diambra.ai.</p></div><div class="description mt-4"><h4 class="paragraph-title">9. Will DIAMBRA ever change the Services?</h4><p class="paragraph">We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical.</p></div><div class="description mt-4"><h4 class="paragraph-title">10. Does DIAMBRA cost anything?</h4><p class="paragraph">The DIAMBRA Services are free for all. There is no commercial interest in what we do.

DIAMBRA has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions in these Terms.</p><p class="paragraph">Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.</p><p class="paragraph">Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms will survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership of intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p></div><div class="description mt-4"><h4 class="paragraph-title">12.
